# Task Tiles

A visual project management application inspired by Trello, featuring intuitive drag-and-drop functionality for task organization.

## Overview

Task Tiles is a project management tool that provides a visual board interface using cards and columns. Users can efficiently track their project progress by organizing tasks into different workflow stages and moving them through the process using simple drag-and-drop interactions.

## Core Features

### Visual Project Board
- **Card-based Interface**: Tasks are represented as visual cards (tiles) that can be easily managed
- **Column Organization**: Customizable columns to represent different stages of your workflow
- **Drag & Drop Functionality**: Seamless movement of task tiles between columns to update status

### Key Capabilities
- Create and manage multiple project boards
- Add custom columns to match your workflow (e.g., "To Do," "In Progress," "Done")
- Create detailed task tiles with titles and descriptions
- Real-time status updates through drag-and-drop interactions
